They're notes.... Which are in the process of being uploaded from my thumbdrive, so it's probably empty if you're seeing this.

This is where I keep my notes, cheatsheets, links to cheatsheets I find and any other information that I may need to recall where googling it is more annoying. I also take notes as I go so some may seem unfinished, this is supposed to be rather dynamic.
